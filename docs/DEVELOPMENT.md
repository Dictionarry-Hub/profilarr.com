## Branching Model

All work happens on feature branches created off `develop`. When ready, the branch is squash merged
into `develop` via a pull request. The PR title becomes the commit message on `develop`.

Every merge to `develop` triggers a build and deploy to GitHub Pages. There is no staging
environment or soak period. The build either succeeds or it doesn't.

Nothing is committed directly to `develop`. All changes go through pull requests so CI runs before
merging.

## CI

Every pull request targeting `develop` runs these checks:

| Job          | Command                                                           | What it catches                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Format       | `pnpm format:check`                                               | Unformatted code                  |
| Test         | `pnpm test`                                                       | Failing unit tests (Vitest)       |
| Type Check   | `pnpm compile:api`, `pnpm compile:pcd`, `pnpm check`              | TypeScript and Svelte type errors |
| Build + Lint | `pnpm compile:api`, `pnpm compile:pcd`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint` | Build failures, lint errors       |

The four jobs run in parallel and share nothing. Type Check and Build + Lint each compile the API
and PCD data themselves because compiling is cheaper than a job's setup. Build and Lint are one job
because the custom lint rules read the prerendered HTML in `build/`, and moving that output between
jobs as an artifact cost more than lint itself. All four must pass before a PR can be merged. Tests
live in `tests/` at the repository root. PR titles are validated against conventional commit format.

## Deployment

The site is deployed from `Dictionarry-Hub/profilarr.com` to GitHub Pages at
`https://profilarr.com`. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `develop`, on demand,
and daily at 21:30 UTC (7am Adelaide) so PCD data changes go out without a code change. Each run
compiles the API reference and only the Dictionarry PCD database
(`pnpm compile:pcd -- --only dictionarry`), builds, and publishes `build/`. Runs never overlap: a
newer run waits for the current deploy.

The job only runs in that repository. `Dictionarry-Hub/website` has the same code, but its Pages
site serves `v1.dictionarry.dev` from the `v3` branch. GitHub disables scheduled workflows in public
repositories after 60 days without activity, so a quiet stretch can stop the daily run until it is
re-enabled.

The site is built with `pnpm build`, which runs adapter-static and outputs plain HTML, CSS, and JS
to `build/`. Production builds require `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`; CI maps it from the `SITE_URL` GitHub
Actions variable. Deployment workflows must use the same mapping so generated links and canonical
metadata share one origin. This output is deployed to GitHub Pages.

There is no runtime, no server process, and no environment variables at serve time. Deployment is
copying files.

Search Elo ranking is controlled by the optional build-time `PUBLIC_SEARCH_ELO_ENABLED` variable. It
defaults to `false`; set it to `true` to blend Elo ratings into search results. The same variable
works in development and requires a development-server restart when changed.

The work-in-progress banner at the top of every page is controlled by the optional build-time
`PUBLIC_WIP_BANNER` variable. It shows unless the variable is `false`; the sidebar, content, and
anchor offsets collapse to the top when it is hidden. Like the Elo switch, it needs a
development-server restart when changed.
